Lab_SezinTekin: This lab assignment performs gene expression analysis by plotting the expression profiles of two specific genes over time, calculating their Spearman correlation, identifying genes with high and low variances, and visualizing gene expression patterns using a cluster map.

Lab2_SezinTekin: The code provided defines a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with specific states, observations, start probabilities, transition probabilities, and emission probabilities. It then initializes an HMM model using these parameters. The forward algorithm and Viterbi algorithm are applied to a given sequence of observations, and the results are printed.


BIO310_HW1_SezinTekin: The provided code is a template for implementing Semi-Global Sequence Alignment. It includes functions for reading sequences from a file, initializing alignment penalties, calculating the score and direction matrices for alignment, performing backtracking to construct the alignment, and executing the Semi-Global Alignment process. The code needs to be modified in several sections to handle Semi-Global Alignment properly, including adapting the penalty initialization, implementing match/mismatch scoring logic, adjusting the scoring and direction matrices, and updating the backtracking process. Once these modifications are made, the code can perform Semi-Global Alignment on given sequences and display the resulting alignment.
