Lab_SezinTekin: This lab assignment performs gene expression analysis by plotting the expression profiles of two specific genes over time, calculating their Spearman correlation, identifying genes with high and low variances, and visualizing gene expression patterns using a cluster map.

Lab2_SezinTekin: The code provided defines a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with specific states, observations, start probabilities, transition probabilities, and emission probabilities. It then initializes an HMM model using these parameters. The forward algorithm and Viterbi algorithm are applied to a given sequence of observations, and the results are printed.
